I am a software and game developer, I run Colormatic and Colormatic Studios, and I primarily study computer science, psychology, and linguistics.
I have an intrinsic urge to create, and that's what Colormatic is all about. My works include world building, music, videos, 3D modeling, video games, websites, programs, and more.
