I have observed that most large projects require some sort of value in order for people to follow through with them to completion, often proportional to the estimated cost of the project. This is a very obvious and general observation, but it has underlying implications that I will explore in this research article.

### Introduction

Value *(noun)*: a fair return or equivalent in goods, services, or money for something exchanged.^1^

I've been interested in the different ways that value can affect human behavior. When something has value, it is sought after; people will go out of their way to obtain it, sometimes even when they don't understand *why* it's valuable. This can lead to a lot of confusing actions from people who are just trying anything to get ahead. It also makes the MacGuffin trope in worldbuilding more relatable.

Let's explore how value interacts with human behavior and interaction.

### What do people find valuable?

Value can be found in a range of different ways, from physical goods and services to relationships and life experiences.

- Some physical goods are necessary for survival, like food, water, shelter, and medicine. Other goods provide information like books and magazines, tools can make tasks easier or possible at all, computers and the internet allow us to communicate and create media to share, and luxury items provide ~~nothing at all~~ a sense of elitism and high status.
- Many people value experiences: exploring the world, spending time with loved ones, and participating in recreational activities.
- Relationships are often seen as invaluable; connection with loved ones are irreplaceable and can provide great fulfillment to one's life.
- Knowledge and skills are things that people will spend their entire careers and lives pursuing, they enable people to extend their scope of capability.
- Time is often regarded as the most valuable resource; leading people to find ways to optimize and reclaim it.

### How does value play a role in society?

From economic systems to social hierarchies, value is one of the key aspects in shaping societal structures and interactions.

A large portion of modern human progress is based around investment ventures, where wealthy figures will provide funding to projects that match their values when they believe it is likely to be successful. This creates a decision process where investors will judge the value of a given venture.^2^

In markets and trade, demand is determined by how much the customers need/want and value the product or service. In this scenario, the customer will judge the product based on the information given, such as product name, product appearance, and brand reputation.

People will judge others based on what they believe to be important, which can cause interpersonal/international/intercorporate conflict when two parties dissent on what they deem valuable.

### How is value measured in arbitrary/emerging subjects?

In my opinion, a good way to measure value on an arbitrary subject is to first define the scope, find the vertical niche that the subject provides, measure quantitative and qualitative aspects, account for the various risks that may come with it, review this data with peers, and finally evaluate your findings to figure out the value of this subject.

Avoid biases like prejudice, excitement, shortsightedness, and peer pressure. See this [list of cognitive biases by The Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases).^3^

### How can people sometimes fail to measure value properly?

A very simple and easy way to misjudge somethings value is to only measure by its price. This seems so straightforward, but you really need to take into account things like reputation, prior experience, and origin.

There's a problem that has especially been prevalent recently, where (most of the time) wealthy individuals and organizations have been chasing short-term gain over everything else. This has and will cause many problems that we will not see the effects of until much later in the future.

Narrow metrics is another great example of poorly measuring value. When people are graded on specific narrow data points like clicks, test scores, etc. they will optimize for that metric and nothing else. This results in people studying things they won't remember, writing way more code than necessary, and generally things that aren't what the manager actually wants.

People on average don't like to change. Generally, people will be less interested in something that could be very good for them if they tried it, but they are either satisfied with where they are or are afraid to leave their comfort zone.

### Conclusion

Value is a core component of human interaction, and a lot of work has and will be done on researching it. The measurement of value is subjective and depends on the people who are measuring, but decision making processes can be improved immensely by using proven methods for avoiding bias, gathering critical data, and working together.

### Notes

This research article took months to complete. Not because it was a lot of work, I'm just really good at procrastinating. I started this article 3 days after the previous blog post and wrote most of what you see here, but I left parts unfinished, only touching up on them occasionally. I did more significant work in mid-July, but it still wasn't done. I finally sat myself down today to finish it. ++10/29/2025++
