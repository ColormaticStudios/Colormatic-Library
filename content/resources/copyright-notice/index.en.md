- **Intellectual Property:** As understood and accepted by US courts; the non-physical property of a person or organization that is understood and remembered for its character and content, rather than a tangible form.

### Policy

We allow third parties to use and republish this material to commentate and critique our work, with the requirement that their derivative works must be transformative.

If we find that a derivative work of our intellectual property from a third party does not meet our requirements, we will contact the related parties to work out a plan to resolve the dispute. This will typically be an email, letter, public forum, or verbal conversation in person or digitally. If the related parties refuse contact or cannot agree on a resolution, we reserve the right to a lawsuit.

We do not provide service to web scrapers with the intention of training machine learning/AI models. All web scrapers that provide found data to AI trainers are not permitted to access this site. Web crawlers that provide found data only to search engines are permitted to access this site, so long as that is their only purpose.

If an AI model is found to contain content sourced from the Colormatic Library, we reserve the right to a lawsuit.
